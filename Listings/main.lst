N * Multibyte Character Functions.
N * The behaviour of the multibyte character functions is affected by the
N * LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding,
N * each function is placed into its initial state by a call for which its
N * character pointer argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s
N * as other than a null pointer cause the internal state of the function to be
N * altered as necessary. A call with s as a null pointer causes these functions
N * to return a nonzero value if encodings have state dependency, and a zero
N * otherwise. After the LC_CTYPE category is changed, the shift state of these
N * functions is indeterminate.

N  *              - To use or not the peripherals drivers in application code(i.e. 
N  *                code will be based on direct access to peripherals registers 
N  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by

N/** @brief Reset the Handle's State field.
N  * @param __HANDLE__: specifies the Peripheral Handle.
N  * @note  This macro can be used for the following purpose: 
N  *          - When the Handle is declared as local variable; before passing it as parameter
N  *            to HAL_PPP_Init() for the first time, it is mandatory to use this macro 
N  *            to set to 0 the Handle's "State" field.
N  *            Otherwise, "State" field may have any random value and the first time the function 
N  *            HAL_PPP_Init() is called, the low level hardware initialization will be missed
N  *            (i.e. HAL_PPP_MspInit() will not be executed).
N  *          - When there is a need to reconfigure the low level hardware: instead of calling
N  *            HAL_PPP_DeInit() then HAL_PPP_Init(), user can make a call to this macro then HAL_PPP_Init().
N  *            In this later function, when the Handle's "State" field is set to 0, it will execute the function
N  *            HAL_PPP_MspInit() which will reconfigure the low level hardware.

N    /*
N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.
